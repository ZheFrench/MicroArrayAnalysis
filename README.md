# MicroArrayAnalysis

Arrays CEL files were processed using R version 3.6.

They were preprocessed by Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) from the Oligo R Package version 1.48.0. The package Limma version 3.40.6 was used to identify genes differentially expressed filtered by a p-value of 0.05 and a fold change of 1.1. Both paired and unpaired analysis were executed.
